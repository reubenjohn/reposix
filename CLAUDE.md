# CLAUDE.md — reposix project guide

This file is read by every agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.) that opens this repo. It's the local extension of the user's global CLAUDE.md (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) and overrides nothing — it adds project-specific rules.

## Project elevator pitch

reposix exposes REST-based issue trackers (and similar SaaS systems) as a git-native partial clone, served by `git-remote-reposix` from a local bare-repo cache built from REST responses. Agents use `cat`, `grep`, `sed`, and `git` on real workflows — no MCP tool schemas, no custom CLI, no FUSE mount. See `docs/research/initial-report.md` for the architectural argument and `docs/research/agentic-engineering-reference.md` for the dark-factory pattern that motivates the simulator-first approach.

## Architecture (git-native partial clone)

> **Source of truth:** `.planning/research/v0.9-fuse-to-git-native/architecture-pivot-summary.md` (ratified 2026-04-24).

The reposix runtime has three pieces:

- **`reposix-cache`** — a real on-disk bare git repo built from REST responses via the `BackendConnector` trait. The cache produces a fully populated tree (filenames, directory structure, blob OIDs) but materializes blobs lazily — only when the helper requests one on git's behalf. Every materialization writes a row to the SQLite audit table; bytes return wrapped in `reposix_core::Tainted<Vec<u8>>`.
- **`git-remote-reposix`** — a hybrid git remote helper. It advertises `stateless-connect` (read path: tunnels protocol-v2 fetch traffic to the cache's bare repo with `--filter=blob:none`) and `export` (push path: parses the fast-import stream, runs push-time conflict detection against the backend, applies REST writes on success). Refspec namespace is `refs/heads/*:refs/reposix/*`.
- **`reposix init <backend>::<project> <path>`** — bootstraps a partial-clone working tree: `git init`, `extensions.partialClone=origin`, `remote.origin.url=reposix::<scheme>://<host>/projects/<project>`, then `git fetch --filter=blob:none origin`.

After `init`, agent UX is pure git: `cd <path> && git checkout origin/main && cat issues/<id>.md && grep -r TODO . && <edit> && git add . && git commit && git push`. Zero reposix CLI awareness required beyond `init`.

Two guardrails are load-bearing for the dark-factory pattern:

- **Push-time conflict detection.** The helper checks backend state when `git push` runs and rejects with the standard git "fetch first" error if the remote drifted. The agent recovers via `git pull --rebase && git push` — no custom protocol.
- **Blob limit.** The helper refuses `command=fetch` requests that would materialize more than `REPOSIX_BLOB_LIMIT` blobs (default 200), with a stderr error that names `git sparse-checkout` as the recovery move. An agent unfamiliar with reposix observes the error and recovers without prompt engineering.

## Operating Principles (project-specific)

The user's global Operating Principles in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` are bible. The following are project-specific reinforcements, not replacements:

1. **Simulator is the default / testing backend.** The simulator at `crates/reposix-sim/` is the default backend for every demo, unit test, and autonomous agent loop. Real backends (GitHub via `reposix-github`, Confluence via `reposix-confluence`, JIRA via `reposix-jira`) are guarded by the `REPOSIX_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` egress allowlist and require explicit credential env vars (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `ATLASSIAN_API_KEY` + `ATLASSIAN_EMAIL` + `REPOSIX_CONFLUENCE_TENANT`, `JIRA_EMAIL` + `JIRA_API_TOKEN` + `REPOSIX_JIRA_INSTANCE`). Autonomous mode never hits a real backend unless the user has put real creds in `.env` AND set a non-default allowlist. This is both a security constraint (fail-closed by default) and the StrongDM dark-factory pattern.
2. **Tainted by default.** Any byte that came from a remote (simulator counts) is tainted. Tainted content must not be routed into actions with side effects on other systems (e.g. don't echo issue bodies into `git push` to remotes outside an explicit allowlist). The lethal-trifecta mitigation matters even against the simulator, because the simulator is *seeded* by an agent and seed data is itself attacker-influenced.
3. **Audit log is non-optional.** Every network-touching action — every blob materialization, every `command=fetch`, every `export` push (accept and reject) — gets a row in the simulator's SQLite audit table. If a feature can't write to the audit log, it's not done.
4. **No hidden state.** Cache state, simulator state, and git remote helper state all live in committed-or-fixture artifacts. No "it works in my session" bugs.
5. **Working tree IS a real git checkout.** The whole point of v0.9.0 is that `.git/` is real, not synthetic; `git diff` is the change set by construction, not by emulation. The partial clone (`extensions.partialClone=origin`) makes blobs lazy, but everything else is upstream git.
6. **Real backends are first-class test targets.** Three canonical targets are sanctioned for aggressive testing: **Confluence space "TokenWorld"** (owned by the user; safe to mutate freely), **GitHub repo `reubenjohn/reposix` issues** (ours; safe to create/close issues during tests), and **JIRA project `TEST`** (default key; overridable via `JIRA_TEST_PROJECT` or `REPOSIX_JIRA_PROJECT`). See `docs/reference/testing-targets.md` for env-var setup, owner permission statement, and cleanup procedure. Simulator remains the default (OP-1), but "simulator-only coverage" does NOT satisfy acceptance for transport-layer or performance claims.

## GSD workflow

This project uses GSD (`get-shit-done`) for planning and execution. Workflow rule:

> **Always enter through a GSD command.** Never edit code outside a GSD-tracked phase or quick.

Entry points:

- `/gsd-quick` — small fix or doc tweak.
- `/gsd-execute-phase <n>` — run a planned phase end-to-end with subagents.
- `/gsd-debug` — investigate a bug.
- `/gsd-progress` — what's the state of the project right now.

The auto-mode bootstrap from 2026-04-13 set `mode: yolo`, `granularity: coarse`, and enabled all workflow gates (research / plan_check / verifier / nyquist / code_review). Do not silently downgrade these.

## Coding conventions

- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` in every crate.
- `#![warn(clippy::pedantic)]` in every crate. Allow-list specific lints with rationale; never blanket-allow `pedantic`.
- All public items documented; missing-doc lint is on for `reposix-core`.
- All `Result`-returning functions have a `# Errors` doc section.
- Tests live next to the code (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`). Integration tests in `tests/`.
- Frontmatter uses `serde_yaml` 0.9 + Markdown body. Never JSON-on-disk for issues.
- Times are `chrono::DateTime<Utc>`. No `SystemTime` in serialized form.

## Build memory budget (load-bearing — read before parallelizing)

**The VM has crashed twice from RAM pressure caused by parallel cargo workspace builds.** The reposix workspace links large crates (`gix` chain, `rusqlite-bundled`, `reqwest+rustls`); a single `cargo check --workspace` peaks rustc + linker around 4–6 GB; `cargo test --workspace` is worse because rustc + N test binaries all link in parallel by default.

**Hard rules — both apply, no exceptions without explicit user override:**

1. **Never run more than one cargo invocation at a time.** This includes `cargo check`, `cargo build`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`. If two subagents both need to compile, they run sequentially, not in parallel. Coordinator-level safe rule: at most one phase-executor subagent doing cargo work at a time. Doc-only / planning-only subagents can still run in parallel with one cargo subagent.
2. **Prefer per-crate over workspace-wide:** `cargo check -p reposix-cli` instead of `cargo check --workspace` whenever the change is scoped. The pre-push hook covers the workspace-wide gate; you don't need to re-run it locally per commit.

**Soft rules:**

- `cargo build --jobs 2` (or `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2`) is safer than the default `-j$(nproc)` on this machine — set it in `.cargo/config.toml` if you find yourself fighting OOM during a single workspace build.
- `cargo nextest run` materializes test binaries one at a time vs `cargo test`'s parallel link; prefer it for full-workspace test runs.
- Doc-site work (`mkdocs build`, playwright) is cheap on RAM but runs Chromium — combined with cargo, it adds another ~500 MB. Schedule docs work in a no-cargo window.
- `rust-analyzer` in an editor pinned to this repo can use 2–3 GB on its own; close non-active editor instances during heavy build sessions.

**If the VM crashes again:** suspect parallel cargo, suspect rust-analyzer, suspect leftover background processes (`ps aux | grep -E "cargo|rustc"`). Don't blame the linker; blame the orchestration that let two of them run at once.

## Subagent delegation rules

Per the user's global OP #2: "Aggressive subagent delegation." Specifics for this project:

- `gsd-phase-researcher` for any "how do I implement X" question that would consume >100 lines of orchestrator context.
- `gsd-planner` for phase planning. Do not write `PLAN.md` by hand.
- `gsd-executor` for phase execution unless the work is trivially small.
- `gsd-code-reviewer` after every phase ships, before declaring done.
- Run multiple subagents in parallel whenever they're operating on disjoint files.

The orchestrator's job is to route, decide, and integrate — not to type code that a subagent could type.

## Threat model

This project is a textbook lethal-trifecta machine:

| Leg of trifecta | Where it shows up here |
| --- | --- |
| Private data | The partial-clone working tree exposes issue bodies, internal field values, attachments. |
| Untrusted input | Every issue body / comment / title is attacker-influenced text. |
| Exfiltration | `git push` can target arbitrary remotes; the helper + cache make outbound HTTP. |

Cuts that are mandatory and tested:

- **Outbound HTTP allowlist.** The remote helper (`git-remote-reposix`) and the cache materializer (`reposix-cache`) refuse to talk to any origin not in `REPOSIX_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (env var, defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:*` only). All HTTP construction goes through the single `reposix_core::http::client()` factory; clippy's `disallowed_methods` catches direct `reqwest::Client::new()` call sites.
- **No shell escape from `export` / cache writes.** Bytes-in-bytes-out; no rendering, no template expansion. The `Tainted<T>` → `Untainted<T>` conversion is the explicit `sanitize` step where escaping happens.
- **Frontmatter field allowlist.** Server-controlled fields (`id`, `created_at`, `version`, `updated_at`) cannot be overridden by client writes; they are stripped on the inbound `export` path before the REST call.
- **Audit log is append-only.** SQLite WAL, no UPDATE/DELETE on the audit table. Every blob materialization, every fetch, every push (accept and reject) writes a row.

See `research/threat-model-and-critique.md` (produced by red-team subagent) for the full analysis.

## What to do when context fills

If you (the agent) notice this CLAUDE.md getting hard to keep in working memory:

1. Read `.planning/STATE.md` first — it's the entry point.
2. Read the most recent `.planning/phases/*/PLAN.md`.
3. Skim `git log --oneline -20` to know what's recently shipped.
4. Don't read this file linearly; grep for the section you need.
