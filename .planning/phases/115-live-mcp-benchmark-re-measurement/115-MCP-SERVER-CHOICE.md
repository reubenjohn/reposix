# 115-MCP-SERVER-CHOICE.md — MCP-server choice for the P115 token benchmark

**Author:** P115 Task-4 capture executor (L0 workhorse #38, amended #39) · **Date:**
2026-07-16 (UTC) · **Status:** **RESOLVED — live-capture ran on `github-probe`.** The
originally-ratified `atlassian-rovo` (Jira) path is retained below as the infeasible-attempt
evidence trail (not deleted).

This is the Task-1 residual formal note. It is **grounded, not a rubber-stamp**: the choice
is recorded together with the reality captured while wiring it.

## LIVE-CAPTURE CHOICE (resolved 2026-07-16, #39) — `github-probe`

The T4 mcp-arm capture ran on the **official GitHub remote MCP server**, registered as
`github-probe` (`https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/`, plain PAT Bearer from `GITHUB_TOKEN`).
Backend: **`reubenjohn/reposix` issues** — a sanctioned OP-6 real-backend test target. This
was a **[SELF] backend pivot** (§1 of `.planning/SESSION-HANDOVER.md`, within the
escalation-valve bar) because the Jira/`atlassian-rovo` path was exhausted (below), while
the published headline claim is backend-agnostic and already carries a per-backend GitHub
split (85.5%).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Server | `github-probe` (official GitHub remote MCP) |
| URL | `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/` · streamable-HTTP · PAT Bearer |
| Tool surface | **44 tools**, full issue-CRUD present (`list_issues`, `issue_read`, `search_issues`, `issue_write`, `add_issue_comment`) — captured live at `benchmarks/fixtures/mcp_github_catalog.json` |
| Task executed | "read 3 issues (#56, #57, #60), edit 1 (#60 body marker), push" |
| Sessions | **6 = median-of-3 × 2 arms**, all valid (ledger rows 2–7; `running_total` 7/50) |
| mcp-arm proof | JSONL shows real `mcp__github-probe__{issue_read,issue_write,search_issues}` calls in all 3 runs |
| reposix-arm proof | JSONL shows **zero** `mcp__*` calls (pure git/POSIX) in all 3 runs |

**Key results (medians, real captures):** mcp-arm ≈ 21.2k output / 56.1k cache-creation /
550k total input-context / $0.83 per session; reposix-arm ≈ 1.2k output / 18.0k
cache-creation / 242k total input-context / $0.19 per session. reposix is cheaper on every
axis (output ≈94% fewer, cost ≈77% cheaper). The exact published "% fewer tokens" figure is
T5's to define from these captures.

**Two findings captured alongside (evidence trail):**
1. **`reposix-github` is READ-ONLY in this build cut** (`crates/reposix-github/src/lib.rs`
   `create/update/delete_record` return not-supported; documented in `doctor.rs`). The
   reposix arm completed read+edit+local-commit; its `git push` was correctly rejected with
   the read-only-cut error. The token-economy comparison is unaffected (it measures agent
   context size, not backend write capability), but the T4 recipe's assumption that "the
   push writes back to GitHub" does not hold for this cut. Filed for L0.
2. **`github-probe` `issue_read` is lossy for raw markdown** — it HTML-escapes body content
   (`>=` → `&gt;=`) and drops literal angle-bracket content, so an MCP read-modify-write
   round-trip corrupts the body; the reposix arm round-trips raw bytes faithfully. Strong
   evidence for the reposix bytes-in-bytes-out fidelity story.

## Original attempt (SUPERSEDED — infeasible; retained as evidence trail)

> The sections below record the originally-ratified `atlassian-rovo` choice and the three
> independent findings that made it infeasible for the T4 capture. They are **kept, not
> deleted** — the pivot to `github-probe` (above) rests on this evidence. `atlassian-rovo`
> can be revisited if org-admin API-token access + a CRUD-capable Jira MCP are provisioned.

**Official Atlassian remote MCP server ("Rovo") — `atlassian-rovo`.**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Server | `atlassian-rovo` |
| URL | `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp` |
| Transport | streamable-HTTP |
| serverInfo | `atlassian-mcp-server` v1.0.0 |
| Auth | Bearer **API token** (Personal API Token; org-admin-gated) — token value never recorded |
| Scope in Claude Code | Local config, private to the reposix repo (`claude mcp get atlassian-rovo`) |
| Connection status | `✔ Connected` (`claude mcp list`) — handshake succeeds |

Chosen over the community `sooperset/mcp-atlassian` because the official remote requires
no self-hosting and the existing `.env` API token authenticates it (auth refuted the
rotation-#34 "API-token-endpoint blocker" — see `115-ROVO-AUTH-CHECK.md`).

## Evidence the tools LOAD (positive)

- **Smoke session** (mandatory pre-capture check): a nested `claude -p "List every tool
  available to you" --output-format json --dangerously-skip-permissions` run from
  `cwd=<reposix repo>` (where `atlassian-rovo` is local-scoped) listed exactly three
  `mcp__atlassian-rovo__*` tools. Session `52b94471-2c68-4d96-9dcf-7b4674b325a7`; usage
  committed at `benchmarks/captures/mcp-kan-smoke.json`; JSONL under the reposix project
  hash. This proves the MCP context (tool schemas) loads and the tool-loading cost is real.
- The three tools and their exact schemas are captured at
  `benchmarks/fixtures/mcp_jira_catalog.json` (replaces the prior synthetic 35-tool file).

## Blockers — why the T4 mcp-arm capture cannot run as specified (escalated to owner)

Three independent findings, each verified this rotation:

1. **No Jira issue-CRUD tool on this server.** `atlassian-rovo` advertises **only 3
   Teamwork Graph tools**: `getTeamworkGraphContext` (read), `getTeamworkGraphObject`
   (read/hydrate), and `addTeamworkGraphContext` (adds a *relationship* link only —
   blocks/links/tracks). There is **no** `editJiraIssue` / `createJiraIssue` /
   `updateJiraIssue` / JQL-search tool. The server's own instructions say "Do not use
   Teamwork Graph tools for basic CRUD operations." → The benchmark task's **"edit 1
   issue"** step has no tool. (The synthetic fixture assumed a full-CRUD server —
   `sooperset/mcp-atlassian` — which is a *different* server.)
2. **The API token is permission-denied on actual invocation.** A real `tools/call`
   (`getTeamworkGraphContext` on `JiraSpace KAN`, `cloudId=https://reuben-john.atlassian.net`)
   returned: `"You don't have permission to connect via API token. Please ask your
   organization admin for access."` The token authenticates the `initialize` handshake
   (200, tools listed) but is **not authorized to run the tools**. This resolves the
   explicit open caveat (1) in `115-ROVO-AUTH-CHECK.md` ("tool-level authorization scopes
   were NOT verified") — with a negative result.
3. **Jira project KAN has 0 issues.** `reposix init jira::KAN` (which uses reposix's own
   Jira REST v3 basic-auth path — a *different* credential path that works) synced KAN and
   produced an empty tree: commit message `sync(jira:KAN): 0 issues`, `git ls-tree HEAD`
   empty. → Neither arm can "read 3 issues"; there are none. This also blocks the
   reposix-mediated arm, independent of the MCP findings.

Net: the ratified server is reachable and its schemas load (so the *tool-loading* half of
the token economy is measurable, and is captured), but the **end-to-end read+edit+push
task** cannot be executed via `atlassian-rovo` with the current credential, and KAN has no
content to operate on.

## Recommendation for the owner (decision required before spending more of the 50-session budget)

Any ONE of these unblocks a real, comparable capture; all are owner/charter calls:

- **(A) Grant the API token Teamwork-Graph access** (per the error's own instruction: "ask
  your organization admin"), AND **redefine the mcp-arm task** to what the graph tools can
  do — e.g. "read 3 work items + add one relationship link" — since issue-field edits are
  not possible on this server. Requires accepting that the two arms measure a
  read+link workflow, not read+field-edit.
- **(B) Switch the mcp-arm to `sooperset/mcp-atlassian`** (self-hosted, API-token-only,
  full Jira CRUD) so the ratified benchmark task ("read 3, edit 1, push") runs unchanged on
  both arms. This is the server the synthetic fixture was modeled on. Needs setup +
  egress-allowlist review.
- **(C) Seed KAN with ≥3 issues** (via reposix push, sanctioned per OP-6 "if you create a
  throwaway test issue, note it") to unblock the reposix arm regardless — but this alone
  does not fix the MCP arm.

The capture executor did **not** unilaterally pick a server-swap, redefine the ratified
task, or seed KAN, because each changes what the benchmark measures and/or spends the
capped session budget on a comparison that is currently impossible. Honest partial over
fabricated completion.
