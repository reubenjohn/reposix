# PROGRESS — v0.15.0 "Floor"

_A live progress briefing. Refresh at every task/wave/capture boundary in the SAME push; every relief handover refreshes it. A stale progress file is worse than none._

## SHIPPED

- 2026-07-15 — Confluence oid-drift fix (list-vs-get render parity) shipped live on the real backend + reconcile audit — `dc26302` ✅
- 2026-07-15 — Benchmark "session" definition ratified — `3278abc` ✅
- 2026-07-15 — Latency numbers re-measured and corrected to the CI-canonical figures — `9384ca6` / `3845b13` ✅
- 2026-07-15 — Latency doc re-aligned to the corrected numbers — `92c3ab5` ✅
- 2026-07-15 — Benchmark session-spend ledger established (≤50 ceiling) — `4351d48` ✅
- 2026-07-15 — Public roadmap diagram shipped — `fa58ad6` ✅
- 2026-07-15 — JSONL-usage token-economy methodology adopted — `9be5439` ✅
- 2026-07-15 — Real MCP tool surface captured; the planned Jira/atlassian-rovo benchmark path found infeasible (no write tool + token denied + empty project) — recorded honestly, no fabricated numbers — `ece072f` ✅

## NOW

Capturing the live token benchmark on the GitHub backend — both arms (GitHub's official
issue MCP vs reposix's git-native checkout) running the same read-3-issues / edit-1 / push
task against reubenjohn/reposix. The GitHub pivot was chosen after the planned Jira path
proved infeasible; GitHub's MCP loads and functions with the existing token and the reposix
arm syncs 9 real issues. Done = 6 real capture sessions recorded in the ledger, the GitHub
MCP catalog and reposix transcript fixtures replaced with live data, and the CAPTURE_OK
acceptance check green.

## NEXT

1. token-economy.md regenerated from the captured GitHub session JSONL (live 85.5% GitHub regime replaces synthetic baseline)
2. latency.md honest-headline refresh + the 8 waived hero-number rows un-waived
3. P115 closed, CI green on main
4. P116 ADR-010 decision packet (mirror-fanout + slug→id durable-create) → manager ruling
5. then the remaining milestone phases:
   - P117 — Doc-truth launch-blocker purge — not started
   - P118 — Post-bench honesty corrections — not started
   - P119 — Docs/planning simplification (the "P112 RAISE") — not started
   - P120 — CLI + helper error hardening to Rust-compiler-grade — not started
   - P121 — RPX error-code namespace + `reposix explain` — not started
   - P122 — `reposix-remote` + `init` hardening (HIGH carry-forwards) — not started
   - P123 — Quality-runner & catalog integrity hardening — not started
   - P124 — Container-rehearse harness hardening — not started
   - P125 — Real-backend cadence & mirror-drift resilience — not started
   - P126 — Docs-alignment tooling polish — not started
   - P127 — Surprises absorption (OP-8 Slot 1) — not started
   - P128 — Good-to-haves polish + milestone close (OP-9 Slot 2) — not started
