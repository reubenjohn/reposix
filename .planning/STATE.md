# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: P86 SHIPPED 2026-05-01 (dark-factory regression — third arm `dvcs-third-arm`; DVCS-DARKFACTORY-01..02). Awaiting verifier subagent dispatch. Next P87 (surprises absorption, +2 reservation slot 1)
Plan: —
Status: Executing — 9/11 phases complete (P78 + P79 + P80 + P81 + P82 + P83 + P84 + P85 + P86); 14 plans complete
Last activity: 2026-05-01 — P86 plan + execute combined. 3 commits (6e95f31 catalog-first stub + 59fa6aa harness body + close commit). Catalog row `agent-ux/dvcs-third-arm` PASS with 17 asserts (5 static teaching-string greps + 5 `--help` token greps + bus URL composition + cache materialization + attach_walk audit + wire-path delegation). 1 eager-resolution: pivoted from "literal end-to-end push" → "agent UX surface + bus URL composition" with wire-path delegated to `bus_write_happy.rs` (rationale: `git fetch`/`git push` subprocess driving at shell scope is documented best-effort + brittle to env propagation; cargo tests cover wire path with assert_cmd's precise control). TokenWorld arm SUBSTRATE-GAP-DEFERRED behind REPOSIX_DARK_FACTORY_REAL_TOKENWORLD=1 (cross-references P84 SURPRISES-INTAKE).

## Current Focus

**Milestone:** v0.13.0 — DVCS over REST. KICKED OFF 2026-04-30. PROJECT.md Current Milestone section reflects the new scope.

**Last shipped milestone:** v0.12.1 (closed 2026-04-30). Verdict GREEN at `quality/reports/verdicts/milestone-v0.12.1/VERDICT.md` (commit 9ef348e).

**Pre-kickoff checklist (kickoff-recommendations.md § "Pre-kickoff checklist"):**

1. ✅ Open-questions resolved or explicitly deferred — `.planning/research/v0.13.0-dvcs/decisions.md`.
2. ◐ POC scheduled in `research/v0.13.0-dvcs/poc/` — folded into P79 (POC ships first; attach implementation absorbs findings).
3. ✅ Push cadence decided — per-phase, codified in `CLAUDE.md` § GSD workflow (closes backlog 999.4).
4. ◐ `/gsd-review` scheduled — runs after ROADMAP + first PLAN.md drafted, before execution. ROADMAP drafted 2026-04-30; review can run after owner approval.
5. ✅ 3 WAIVED structure rows scheduled — P78 includes verifiers before waiver expires 2026-05-15.
6. ✅ ROADMAP.md drafted — 11 phases (P78–P88) drafted by gsd-roadmapper 2026-04-30; awaiting owner approval.

**Phase decomposition (P78–P88):**

- **P78** — Pre-DVCS hygiene (gix bump + 3 WAIVED-row verifiers + MULTI-SOURCE-WATCH-01 walker schema migration)
- **P79** — POC + `reposix attach` core (POC ships in `research/v0.13.0-dvcs/poc/` first; then attach subcommand)
- **P80** — Mirror-lag refs (`refs/mirrors/confluence-head` + `refs/mirrors/confluence-synced-at`)
- **P81** — L1 perf migration (replace `list_records` walk with `list_changed_since`-based conflict detection; `reposix sync --reconcile` escape hatch)
- **P82** — Bus remote URL parser + cheap prechecks + fetch-not-advertised dispatch
- **P83** — Bus remote write fan-out (SoT-first, mirror-best-effort, fault injection — riskiest phase, may split)
- **P84** — Webhook-driven mirror sync (GH Action workflow + `--force-with-lease` race protection)
- **P85** — DVCS docs (topology, mirror setup, troubleshooting, cold-reader pass)
- **P86** — Dark-factory regression — third arm (vanilla-clone + attach + bus-push)
- **P87** — Surprises absorption (+2 reservation slot 1, OP-8)
- **P88** — Good-to-haves polish + milestone close (+2 reservation slot 2, OP-9 retrospective ritual)

**Coverage:** 36/36 v0.13.0 REQ-IDs mapped to exactly one phase (no orphans, no duplicates).

**Carry-forward bundle:** `.planning/milestones/v0.13.0-phases/CARRY-FORWARD.md` lists `MULTI-SOURCE-WATCH-01` (P78), `GIX-YANKED-PIN-01` (P78), `WAIVED-STRUCTURE-ROWS-03` (P78), `POC-DVCS-01` (P79).

**Next agent action:** verifier subagent dispatch for P86 (grades the `agent-ux/dvcs-third-arm` row from artifacts; verdict at `quality/reports/verdicts/p86/VERDICT.md`). After GREEN: `/gsd-plan-phase 87 → /gsd-execute-phase 87` (surprises absorption, +2 reservation slot 1; drains `.planning/milestones/v0.13.0-phases/SURPRISES-INTAKE.md`). Depends on P78..P86 GREEN.

## Per-milestone history (cross-references)

Historical phase-by-phase contribution narrative lives in per-milestone ARCHIVE files:

- `.planning/milestones/v0.12.1-phases/ARCHIVE.md` — most recently shipped (P72–P77 + owner-TTY close-out).
- `.planning/milestones/v0.12.0-phases/archive/` — Quality Gates framework + 8 dimensions (P56–P65).
- `.planning/milestones/v0.11.0-phases/`, `v0.10.0-phases/`, `v0.9.0-phases/`, `v0.8.0-phases/`, etc. — earlier milestones.

## Project Reference

- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — scope and decisions table (Current Milestone now v0.13.0).
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — milestone-level roadmap (P78–P88 drafted 2026-04-30 by gsd-roadmapper).
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — milestone requirements (36 v0.13.0 REQ-IDs; traceability table mapped to phases).
- `.planning/research/v0.13.0-dvcs/` — full research bundle (vision, architecture, kickoff, decisions, CARRY-FORWARD).
- `CLAUDE.md` — operating principles + per-phase push cadence + Quality Gates protocol.
- `quality/PROTOCOL.md` — Quality Gates runtime contract.
- `quality/SURPRISES.md` — append-only pivot journal.

## Blockers / Concerns

- POC-FINDINGS.md re-engagement checkpoint pending (orchestrator decision; F01 + F04 are REVISE-tagged but small).
- `scripts/tag-v0.10.0.sh` and `scripts/tag-v0.9.0.sh` still exist with unpushed tags (owner gate, pre-existing).
- 3 WAIVED structure rows expired 2026-05-15 — RESOLVED in P78.
- ROADMAP.md top-level still holds v0.12.0 entries (lines 272+). Per CLAUDE.md §0.5, those should relocate to `.planning/milestones/v0.12.0-phases/ROADMAP.md`. Owner-driven cleanup pass; NOT in v0.13.0 phase scope.

## Session Continuity

Frontmatter (above) is the machine-readable cursor. Resume via `/gsd-resume-work` or pick up the milestone with `/gsd-plan-phase 78` after owner approves the roadmap draft.
