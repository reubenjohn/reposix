# reposix

> **Agents already know `cat` and `git`. They don't know your JSON schema.**

reposix is a git-backed FUSE filesystem that exposes REST-based issue trackers (Jira, GitHub Issues, Confluence) as a POSIX directory tree. An autonomous LLM agent can `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, edit, and `git push` tickets without ever loading a single Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool schema.

!!! success "v0.1 alpha — built autonomously in under 5 hours"
    Every line of code in this repository was written by a coding agent overnight on **2026-04-13**, with an adversarial red-team subagent critiquing the design and planners verifying each phase. Treat as alpha — but the full 9-step demo (mount → edit → `git push` → guardrails on camera) is reproducible.

## The one-sentence thesis

```

Same outcome, ~75× less context burned. The ratio is not imaginary — see the [token-economy benchmark](why.md#token-economy-benchmark).

## Five-line quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reubenjohn/reposix
cd reposix
cargo build --release --workspace --bins
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
bash scripts/demo.sh
```

Runs the full nine-step demo against an in-process simulator. No credentials. No network. Exits zero in under 2 minutes.

## What shipped in v0.1

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-file-document: **[Five-crate workspace](reference/crates.md)**

    `-core`, `-sim`, `-fuse`, `-remote`, `-cli`. 133 tests. All crates `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` is clean.

-   :material-shield-lock: **[Eight security guardrails](security.md)**

    SG-01 allowlist · SG-02 bulk-delete cap · SG-03 frontmatter strip · SG-04 path validator · SG-05 tainted typing · SG-06 append-only audit · SG-07 5s EIO timeout · SG-08 demo shows guardrails firing.

-   :material-folder-multiple: **[Working POSIX mount](reference/cli.md#reposix-mount)**

    `reposix mount /tmp/mnt --backend http://127.0.0.1:7878` — issues as `<id>.md` with YAML frontmatter. `ls`, `cat`, `grep -r` all work.

-   :material-source-branch: **[git-remote-reposix helper](reference/git-remote.md)**

    `git push reposix::http://.../projects/demo` translates diffs to `PATCH`/`POST`/`DELETE`. SG-02 fires on pushes deleting >5 issues; overridable via `[allow-bulk-delete]` commit tag.

## The "dark factory" pattern

This project is an experiment in the pattern from Simon Willison's April 2026 interview[^1]: **nobody writes code, nobody reads code**. The replacement for code review is:

1. **A simulator, not mocks.** `crates/reposix-sim` is a full-fidelity fake issue tracker — rate limits, 409 conflicts, append-only audit, all modeled. A swarm of agents can hammer it for free.
2. **Adversarial red-team subagents.** A parallel agent poked holes in the design at T+0 and its findings ([threat model](security.md#threat-model)) became first-class requirements.
3. **Goal-backward verification.** Every phase has Bash-assertion success criteria. The final [`VERIFICATION.md`](https://github.com/reubenjohn/reposix/blob/main/.planning/VERIFICATION.md) walks each of the 17 original requirements → evidence → test name.
4. **Empirical closing of the loop.** Before declaring the demo done, the agent literally ran `bash scripts/demo.sh` end-to-end, verified server state updates via `curl`, and confirmed the allowlist refusal and SG-02 cap fire on the recorded transcript.
