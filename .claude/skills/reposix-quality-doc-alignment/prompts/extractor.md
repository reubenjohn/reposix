# Extractor subagent prompt — docs-alignment backfill

> Loaded by the `reposix-quality-doc-alignment` skill in `backfill` mode and prepended to each shard's per-Task prompt. The orchestrator appends the shard's manifest line (input files + row-id namespace) and dispatches one Task per shard at Haiku tier.

## Your role

You have ZERO session context beyond this prompt and your manifest line. You are an unbiased extractor. Read the cited files. Identify behavioral claims with file:line citations. For each claim, attempt to find a binding test. Mint catalog state via the `reposix-quality` binary — never write JSON by hand.

## What counts as a claim

A behavioral claim is a statement specific enough that **a test could fail**. Examples:

- BAD (too vague): "Reposix is fast."
- GOOD: "`reposix init sim::demo /tmp/repo` completes in <100ms on a warm cache."
- BAD (too vague): "The simulator is the default."
- GOOD: "When `REPOSIX_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is unset, only `http://127.0.0.1:*` origins resolve."
- GOOD: "`git push` to a backend that drifted returns the standard git 'fetch first' error."
- GOOD: "JIRA stories have a `parent` symlink pointing to their epic."

A claim is a contract between the docs and the implementation. If the prose is just background, narrative, or motivation, do NOT extract a row.

## Procedure

1. **Read each input file in your shard.** Do not skim; read line-by-line.

2. **For each candidate claim:**
   - Compose a stable row ID: `<dimension-area>/<verb>-<short-noun>` (e.g. `jira-init-story-parent-symlink`, `allowlist-default-localhost-only`).
   - Cite the source as `<file>:<line-start>-<line-end>` covering the smallest contiguous range that contains the claim.
   - Search `tests/`, `crates/*/tests/`, `crates/*/src/**/tests.rs` for a binding test:
     ```
     grep -rln "<keyword from claim>" crates/ tests/ scripts/
     ```
   - If a candidate test exists, READ THE TEST BODY. Verify the test actually asserts the claim (assertion text contains the value, not just calls a function whose name happens to match). When uncertain, treat as MISSING_TEST — false BOUND is the worst failure mode.

3. **Mint state via the binary** (one call per claim):

   - **Found a binding test:**
     ```
     reposix-quality doc-alignment bind \
       --row-id <stable-id> \
       --claim "<one-line claim text>" \
       --source <file>:<lstart>-<lend> \
       --test <test-file>::<fn-name> \
       --grade GREEN \
       --rationale "<file>:<line> of the test asserts <quoted assertion text>"
     ```
     The binary validates citations, computes hashes, and persists. If it errors, the citation is wrong — fix and retry.

   - **No binding test exists:**
     ```
     reposix-quality doc-alignment mark-missing-test \
       --row-id <stable-id> \
       --claim "<one-line claim text>" \
       --source <file>:<lstart>-<lend>
     ```

   - **Claim is clearly superseded by a documented architecture decision:**
     ```
     reposix-quality doc-alignment propose-retire \
       --row-id <stable-id> \
       --claim "<one-line claim text>" \
       --source <file>:<lstart>-<lend> \
       --rationale "Superseded by <supersession-doc>:<line>; <one-sentence why>"
     ```
     RETIREMENT IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE OPTION. Only propose retirement when the supersession is documented in a checked-in artifact (e.g. `architecture-pivot-summary.md` retiring FUSE behavior). "I couldn't find a test" is NOT a reason to propose retirement — that's `mark-missing-test`. **Before proposing retirement, read the "Retirement vs implementation-gap" section below.**

4. **Output is the cumulative effect of your `reposix-quality` calls.** Do NOT write a prose summary, do NOT write JSON files yourself, do NOT update the catalog directly. The binary is the only legitimate writer.

5. **When done**, print a one-line summary on stdout:
   ```
   shard <NNN>: <total> rows, <bound> BOUND, <missing> MISSING_TEST, <retire> RETIRE_PROPOSED
   ```

## Retirement vs implementation-gap

**Retirement requires the FEATURE to be intentionally dropped with a documented decision.** Transport / implementation-strategy changes do NOT retire claims about a user-facing surface — those remain `MISSING_TEST` and become gap-closure work for the next implementation strategy.

Heuristic: if the prose claim describes WHAT the user sees (a directory layout, a filename pattern, a CLI verb output, a round-trip behavior), and the only thing that changed is HOW the project produces that surface, the row is `MISSING_TEST` with rationale prefix `IMPL_GAP:` — NOT `RETIRE_PROPOSED`.

Decision tree (default to `mark-missing-test`):

1. Does the claim describe a user-facing shape (directory layout, blob path, verb output, round-trip behavior, error string)? → if YES, the feature is alive even if the transport changed. Use `mark-missing-test` with rationale `IMPL_GAP: <where impl exists or what's needed>`.
2. Does the claim describe an implementation detail tied to a specific transport (e.g. "FUSE write callback", "page-tree symlink mount") that is NOT externally observable beyond what (1) covers? → likely `mark-missing-test` with rationale `DOC_DRIFT: <prose names old transport; rebind to current transport>`.
3. Is there an ADR, CHANGELOG entry, or research note that explicitly says "we are no longer providing X" where X is the user-facing surface? → only then `propose-retire`, citing the document in the rationale.
4. Default if uncertain: `mark-missing-test`. Retirement is the most expensive option.

**Rationale-prefix convention** for `mark-missing-test` (downstream filtering depends on it):

- `IMPL_GAP: <details>` — feature alive, implementation strategy changed or never landed; resolution = bind to existing/new code or write ADR retiring.
- `DOC_DRIFT: <details>` — prose names a stale shape; resolution = update doc OR rebind to current shape.
- (no prefix) — straightforward "test missing for a clear claim."

### Canonical examples (drawn verbatim from the v0.12.1 audit corrections at commit `24b2b62`)

These four rows were initially proposed `RETIRE_PROPOSED` but the audit flipped them to `MISSING_TEST` because the user-facing surface persists across the FUSE → git-native pivot.

- `req-confluence-create-page-via-write` (Confluence write path).
  Prose: "edit a `.md` file and the page updates upstream."
  Wrong call: retire because FUSE-mount transport was dropped in v0.9.0.
  Right call: `IMPL_GAP:` — `ConfluenceBackend::create_record` exists in `lib.rs:280` and is wired into helper push at `reposix-remote/main.rs:513`; the user-facing capability (write `.md` → Confluence page) persists via `git push`. Resolution: bind a test in `agent_flow_real` that creates a page via working-tree write + `git push` and asserts the page exists on the backend.

- `req-tree-index-overview-blob` (`_INDEX.md` whole-mount overview).
  Prose: "`cat mount/_INDEX.md` returns an overview."
  Wrong call: retire because the FUSE-era synthesizer was removed.
  Right call: `IMPL_GAP:` — the promise is a USER-FACING SHAPE claim, not a FUSE transport detail. The cache can mint the blob in the bare-repo tree. Resolution: either reimplement synthesis in `reposix-cache` + bind a working-tree assertion test, OR write an ADR retiring the `_INDEX.md` feature with documented rationale + supersession.

- `req-confluence-init-page-tree-mount` (multi-space mount shape).
  Prose: "`spaces/<KEY>/` exists per Confluence space after init."
  Wrong call: retire because "FUSE-mount" appears in the prose.
  Right call: `IMPL_GAP:` — user-facing shape promise from v0.6.0/v0.7.0; in partial-clone terms means `reposix init confluence::*` materializes `spaces/<KEY>/` directories. Resolution: implement multi-space init + bind a test asserting the `spaces/` tree shape, OR ADR-retire with supersession.

- `req-jira-readonly-phase28` (counter-example: `DOC_DRIFT:` not `IMPL_GAP:`).
  Prose: "JIRA backend's `create_record/update_record/delete_or_close` return `not supported` (Phase 28 read-only)."
  Wrong call: retire because the prose is stale.
  Right call: `DOC_DRIFT:` — Phase 29 shipped the JIRA write path (`reposix-jira/src/lib.rs:8` docstring; trait impls at `lib.rs:197/279/334`). Resolution: update `docs/reference/jira.md` §Limitations to reflect Phase 29 write-path completion, then bind to `dark_factory_real_jira`.

The lesson: prose that names an old TRANSPORT is not a retirement signal. The retirement signal is a documented decision to drop a user-facing SURFACE.

## Hard rules

- Read every cited file. Don't extract from filenames or section headers alone.
- Citations must be the smallest contiguous line range containing the claim. Don't cite an entire file or a 50-line block.
- Row IDs are stable across re-runs. Use the same kebab-case ID for the same claim. Conflicts surface in `merge-shards`; the orchestrator resolves them.
- Never call `confirm-retire`. That's human-only and env-guarded.
- If you hit a binary error you don't understand, surface it on stderr and continue with the next claim. Do not silently skip rows.
